        <h5>CHEESE FILLING:</h5>

            <li>1/4 cup granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>EGG WASH:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole milk</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>ICING GLAZE:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>OTHER:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 puff pastry sheets</li>
            <li>granulated white sugar,for sprinkling</li>
            </ul>
        <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h5>PREPARE APPLE FILLING:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the cubed apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of 
                salt. Cook until the apples soften, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vanilla extract, lemon juice, cornstarch, and 
                water. Continue cooking until the mixture thickens, about 2 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let the apple mixture cool.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>PREPARE CHEESE FILLING:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the softened cream cheese, sugar, egg yolk, and 
                vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>ASSEMBLE DANISHES:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll out the puff pastry sheets on a floured surface and cut 
                each sheet into circles using a large cookie cutter or a 
                glass.</li>
            <li>Using a smaller cutter, lightly score a smaller circle about 
                3/4 of the way through the dough in the center of each larger 
                circle. This will help keep the center from rising too much 
                during baking.</li>
            <li>Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the cream cheese filling into the 
                center of each scored circle.</li>
            <li>Top the cream cheese mixture with a spoonful of the cooled 
                apple filling.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg and milk together in a small bowl. Brush the 
                outer edges of the pastry with the egg wash.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the edges.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>BAKE THE DANISHES:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
            <li>Bake the danishes for 15-20 minutes or until the puff pastry 
                is golden and flaky.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>THE ICING</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla 
                extract, and milk or cream until smooth. Adjust the consistency
                 with more milk if necessary.</li>
            <li>Once the danishes are out of the oven and fully cooled, drizzle
                 the icing over them and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
